RentMark 2.0 is a React Front End Application that communicates to a backend API built in Express and Node.js


The production URL for this application can be found at https://rent-mark-front-end-react.herokuapp.com

Currently, this project is incomplete as Authentication and Authorization in a SOA application has not been built out. To navigate page flow, you can manually type in the URL. For example. /units will take you to the units dashboard. /users will take you to the users dashboard. /events will take you to the events dashboard.



This project is ongoing.

The backend production url can be found at https://rentmark2-backend.herokuapp.com
